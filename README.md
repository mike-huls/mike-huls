### Hi, I'm Mike!
I'm a full-stack developer from the Netherlands with a passion for programming and traveling.

I believe that the vast amount of data that's available nowadays is of invaluable importance to decision-making.
Whether the decision concern a multi million investment, what shows you get recommended on Netflix or 
where to best buy those plane-tickets; data can improve decisions in virtually all facets of life.

Data without a goal, however, is like a jerrycan of gasoline. It can help you do many things
but it's not of any use on its own. 
Like gasoline needs a car, data needs a goal to be used for; to explore, clearify and substantiate in order to
improve your decision-making. It is my goal to create software that makes data actionable.
It helps people to see, understand, use and improve their decision-making with data. 

Interested in how I do this?
