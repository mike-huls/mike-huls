### Hi, I'm Mike
Join me on my quest of becoming a better programmer.

I'm a developer from the Netherlands with a passion for programming and traveling. 
My bread and butter consists mostly of Python, SQL, and Docker but I work, tweak and experiment with all kinds of techniques, tools and frameworks; frontend, backend and everything inbetween.

I like to write about interesting techniques, system architecture, and thoughtful approaches to software design, among many other topics. 
My focus isnâ€™t just on making things work but on truly understanding why they work, how they fit into the context and how to apply them.
